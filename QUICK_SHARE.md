# Quick Share Guide - For Non-Technical Users

## The Easiest Way: Streamlit Cloud

### What Your Colleagues Need:
- ✅ A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - any browser works!)
- ✅ An internet connection
- ✅ That's it! No installation, no setup, no technical knowledge needed.

### What You Need to Do (One-Time Setup):

1. **Create a GitHub account** (free, takes 2 minutes)
   - Go to: https://github.com/join
   - Choose a username and password
   - Verify your email

2. **Upload your project to GitHub**
   - Follow the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Or ask a technical colleague to help with this step

3. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** (takes 5 minutes)
   - Go to: https://share.streamlit.io
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New app"
   - Select your repository
   - Click "Deploy!"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes

4. **Share the link!**
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://your-app-name.streamlit.app`
   - Send this link to your colleagues
   - They click it and start using the app immediately!

## Alternative: Share Files Directly

If you can't use Streamlit Cloud, you can share the files:

1. **Copy the entire folder** to a USB drive or shared network folder
2. **Share these files with colleagues:**
   - The entire `bps_database_play` folder
   - The `USER_GUIDE.md` file (print it or email it)

3. **Colleagues run:**
   - Double-click `setup_and_run.sh` (Linux/Mac)
   - Or follow instructions in `USER_GUIDE.md`

## What to Tell Your Colleagues

Once you have the link, send them this message:

---

**Subject: New BPS Database Explorer Tool**

Hi everyone,

I've set up a new web tool to search and explore BPS models. 

**To use it:**
1. Click this link: [YOUR_STREAMLIT_CLOUD_LINK]
2. Type in the search box to find models
3. Click "Download Document" to get Word files

**No installation needed** - just open the link in your web browser!

See the USER_GUIDE.md file for more details, or let me know if you have questions.
